Blender4.2, WIP grade and fbx zipped, rigged w/ Blender rigify4.

Some fallout from a long winded animation trek as a cat was revisited.

This is an extremely free/pastime tier rigging job and all model credit goes to this guy: https://www.deviantart.com/skunkdude13 (Niche-warning if you'd like avoiding exposure to or do not stomach certain affinities.)

- There is a limited asset/pose library and some pre-made actions from the ground up (mostly idle effects) and mocap (bigger motions) libraries.

- Most weighting is automatic except some gross detailing on the face albeit rather coarse.

- There is a toon outline that works with cycles and Shima can switch between realistic and flat shading, refer to the materials and their driven values.

- The skirt is what it is, and will clip for extreme movements (in the leg area, I do not have the current intuition for weighting it quickly atm).

- The model is SFW, except for generally overblown body shapes.

Enjoy, dislike or improve further!
